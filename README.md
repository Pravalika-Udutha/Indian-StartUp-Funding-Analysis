# Indian StartUp Funding Analysis

Welcome to the **Indian StartUp Funding Analysis** project! This initiative delves into the funding landscape of Indian startups, offering insights into trends, key players, and the overall ecosystem.


## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing funding data of Indian startups to uncover patterns and provide a comprehensive understanding of the startup environment in India. By cleaning and examining the dataset, we aim to answer critical questions about funding trends, prominent sectors, and investor behavior.

## Repository Structure

- **Data Cleaning.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook dedicated to preprocessing and cleaning the raw startup funding data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **app.py**: A Python script, possibly designed to launch a web application or perform further data analysis.
- **startup_funding.csv**: The original dataset containing raw data on Indian startup funding.
- **startup_cleaned.csv**: The processed dataset after cleaning, ready for analysis.
